## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About the project
This project aims to enhance the user experiance of MOI mobile app, accessibility, and user engagement. By incorporating Unity integration for a 3D environment, enhanced text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) interaction, a point system, virtualized app environment, and user feedback integration, the app seeks to provide a more immersive, intuitive, and rewarding experience for all users.


## Introduction
- <p style="color: red;">Gamification can revolutionize the way citizens interact with government services. By infusing digital experiences with game, like elements, we aim to increase engagement, streamline service access, and foster a more positive relationship between the public and their government.</p>

### üîç Problems:

- <p style="color: red;">Despite being well-designed, but faces usability challenges.</p>

- <p style="color: red;">Users, including diverse groups such as the young, elderly, and people of determination, find the app slightly complicated to navigate.</p>

- <p style="color: red;">The app's complexity results in a lack of motivation among users to utilize its services fully.</p>

- <p style="color: red;">Accessibility features for people of determination are limited, hindering their ability to benefit from the app's offerings.</p>

- <p style="color: red;">There is a pressing need to address these usability issues and enhance accessibility to ensure the app effectively serves all demographics and maximizes its societal impact.</p>


### üí° Solution:

### Unity Integration for 3D Environment
- Implement Unity to enhance the app's interface with a 3D environment.
- Offer a more immersive and intuitive user experience for navigation.
- Enable interaction with elements in the 3D environment to improve user understanding and engagement.

### Enhanced TTS / STT Interaction
- Upgrade the existing TTS feature to make it more interactive and user-friendly.
- Enable TTS system to interact with users.
- Implement STT feature for verbal commands or requests.
- Benefit users with speech impairments or limited dexterity.

### Gamification with Point System
- Introduce a point system to gamify the user experience.
- Users earn points for completing tasks or achieving milestones.
- Points can be redeemed for rewards, discounts, or exclusive benefits.
- Encourage exploration and engagement with app features.

### Virtualized App Environment
- Create a virtualized environment simulating real-world scenarios.
- Users navigate through virtual representations of government offices or public spaces.
- Gamify the environment to motivate exploration and task completion.

### User Feedback Integration
- Incorporate mechanisms for collecting and analyzing user feedback.
- Gather insights to identify pain points and areas for enhancement.
- Regular updates based on user feedback to improve usability and effectiveness.


## üöÄ Technologies

Technologies that We used to develop this 3D Edition mobile App:

- [Unity 3D](https://unity.com/)
- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [Gamification Mechanics](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gamification)
- [Interactive 3D Elements](https://threejs.org/)



## Trade-offs and Additional Considerations

### Gamification Complexity vs. User Engagement
Designing gamification elements, like point systems, requires a delicate balance between engaging users and avoiding complexity overload. Prioritizing intuitive design encourages sustained user interaction.

### Speech Recognition Accuracy vs. Performance
Balancing speech-to-text (STT) accuracy with app performance is crucial, especially on devices with limited processing power. Developers must optimize both aspects to ensure a smooth user experience.

### What Could Have Been Added

#### Localization Support
Incorporating localization features caters to users from various regions and language backgrounds. Multilingual support enhances user accessibility and improves overall user experience.

#### Offline Functionality
Adding offline functionality improves usability in areas with limited internet access. It ensures uninterrupted usage and enhances accessibility for users in regions with unreliable connectivity.
